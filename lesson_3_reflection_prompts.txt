When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	When you are running a project with a team. It is better to contribute in a common remote repository rather than keeping constantly all your work localy.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Because you are having the control of what is pulling back.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork clones the repository between two github profiles.
    Clone clones a repository localy to your pc from a github
    repository.
    Branches can run in parallel while several people contribute
    in different parts of the main project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So as to trace it back.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I used to collaborate through facebook, sending to each other the code file. Nothing was easier because it was such a mesh. Now that I have learned git and github my life and my project became much more easier and structured. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
